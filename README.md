# CO₂ Climate Change Model

## Project Summary

The **CO₂ Climate Change Model** is a simulation project aimed at understanding the impact of carbon dioxide (CO₂) levels on Earth's climate. By utilizing simple climate models, this project examines how variations in CO₂ concentrations affect the greenhouse effect, energy balance, and global temperatures over time.

### Key Objectives

- **Simulate CO₂ Levels**: Model both stable and doubled CO₂ concentrations to analyze their effects on climate.
- **Energy Balance Analysis**: Evaluate how incoming solar radiation and outgoing heat interact under different CO₂ scenarios.
- **Heat Transport Efficiency**: Investigate changes in heat transport efficiency due to increased greenhouse gases.
- **Temperature Visualization**: Provide graphical representations of temperature changes over time to illustrate the model's findings.

### Importance

This project contributes to a deeper understanding of climate change mechanisms and the role of greenhouse gases. It serves as an educational tool for those interested in climate science, helping to visualize the relationships between CO₂ levels and global temperature shifts.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for the simulations and calculations.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **SciPy**: For scientific computing tasks, including solving differential equations.
